# Email Subscriptions

Admin staff can upload a CSV of email leads to subscribe them to specified DoSomething email newsletters.

Before uploading and importing the records, the admin staff can specify which newletter subscription will be added to each record that is processed.

As each record in the CSV is processed and imported into the system, if an existing user is found with email from the processed record, then it will update the existing user's email subscriptions or it will create a new user with the specified email subscription.

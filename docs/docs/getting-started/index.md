# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Great work! You've found the technical documentation for the [DoSomething.org](https://www.dosomething.org) administrative website and services.

The admin application is built using [Laravel 6.0](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x), [OAuth 2.0 Server](https://oauth2.thephpleague.com), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com), and [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/).

This documentation resource can help get you started understanding and working with the different components that make up the admin app frontend and backend.

But before you can start working on the app, lets first get you all [set up](installation)!
